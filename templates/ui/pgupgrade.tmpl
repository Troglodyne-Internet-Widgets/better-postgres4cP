<p>
PostgreSQL is <em>the best</em> relational database management system you can conceive of, even on cPanel systems.
This interface allows you to upgrade your PostgreSQL server to a newer version.
Yum and cPanel will automagically upgrade PostgreSQL installations to newer point releases (the third digit in the version string),
as these upgrades involve little risk to your usersâ€™ data.
Upgrades to new major releases (the first two digits in the version string) are more involved because there is a substantial risk of data loss.
This interface at least attempts to take care of those issues for you.
</p>
<div class="callout callout-info">
    <p>Although in-place upgrades are generally safe, you should always perform a full database backup before you begin the upgrade process.</p>
    <p>
        Please note that downgrades to previous versions are not allowed by this software. After you upgrade your system to a newer version,
        any consequences related to switching back are your responsibility alone.
